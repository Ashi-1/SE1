->A variant of the Waterfall that emphasizes theverification and validationof the product.
->Testing of the product is planned in parallel with a corresponding phase of development

V shaped Steps:
->Project and Requirements Planning – allocate resource
->Product Requirements and Specification Analysis – complete specification of the software system
->Architecture or High-Level Design – defines how software functions fulfill the design
->Detailed Design – develop algorithms for each architectural component
->Production, operation and maintenance – provide for enhancement and corrections
->System and acceptance testing – check the entire software system in its environment
->Integration and Testing – check that modules interconnect correctly
->Unit testing – check that each module acts as expected
->Coding – transform algorithms into software

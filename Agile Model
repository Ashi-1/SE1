This is an intro to agile model.


Agile is a software development methodology to build a software incrementally using short
iterations of 1 to 4 weeks so that the development process is aligned with the changing
business needs. Instead of a single-pass development of 6 to 18 months where all the
requirements and risks are predicted upfront, Agile adopts a process of frequent feedback
where a workable product is delivered after 1 to 4-week iteration.
